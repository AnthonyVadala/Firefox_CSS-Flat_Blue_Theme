# Firefox Themes


Flat_Blue:
=============
This Firefox theme is ment to be used with the latest version of Firefox (29+ for australis).
Copy and paste the CSS into an addon like [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/stylish/) to apply the theme to your browser.

This is still a work in progress so tell me if there is any issues.
